# Golden Ration experiments 

In an effort to test and experiment with the golden ratio (1.6180...)

## About the script

This script takes two random numbers and determines the amount of iterations to the golden ratio.
What I found when writing this, is that with any two random numbers, the max number of iterations will never exceed 42.
This can also be said with any two negative numbers. This cannot be said about a negative and a positive number.
